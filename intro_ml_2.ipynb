    "\n",
    "1. **Validation Curves:**\n",
    "   - Plot the model's performance on both the training and validation sets across different levels of model complexity (e.g., varying hyperparameters). If the training performance continues to improve while the validation performance plateaus or degrades, it indicates overfitting.\n",

    "3. **Cross-Validation:**\n",
    "   - Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance on multiple subsets of the data. Large discrepancies between training and validation performance may indicate overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Regularization Paths:**\n",
    "   - Examine the impact of regularization strength on model performance. If increasing regularization leads to better validation performance, it suggests overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Prediction Metrics:**\n",
    "   - Evaluate the model using various prediction metrics on both the training and validation sets. Large disparities in performance metrics can indicate overfitting.\n",

    "   - Similar to detecting overfitting, validation curves can also reveal underfitting. If both the training and validation performance are poor, it suggests the model is too simple.\n",

    "3. **Feature Importance:**\n",
    "   - If the model is underfitting, examining feature importance may reveal that important relationships in the data are not adequately captured. Consider adding relevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Complexity:**\n",
    "   - Compare the chosen model's complexity to the complexity required to capture the underlying patterns in the data. If the model is too simple, it may underfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**\n",
    "   - Evaluate different hyperparameter settings. If increasing model complexity or adjusting hyperparameters improves validation performance, it suggests underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Visual Inspection:**\n",
